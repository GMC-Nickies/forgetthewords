			<h3>THE WAY OF THE SULTANATE</h3>
			<p>
				There are three tenets one must keep in walking the Plane:
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">
				1. Assert your will, keeping reverence only to the Holy One who is above us all. Even the Great Sultan is only a servant. But do not regard members of any sector as your peer, but at most as a student, and yourself the disciplinary teacher.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">
				2. Follow the Rules of Engagement when dealing with other Planewalkers. Follow them for the sake of following them â€“ do not believe in them for yourself, for the time will come when they will be cast aside.
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">
				3. The Plane can be horrifying to the soul. Careful that you do not tread too lightly, lest you be consumed. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. Yet the purpose of life is not to be happy.
